# CrappyChess
A chess game I made while learning openGL, please enjoy responsibly

It's built using openGL, glfw3, glew, glm and SOIL

The required libraries and headers are provided for building on windows, for other platforms you'll have to get those things sorted out
on your own. 

There is a windows 32 bit .exe in Chess.zip, with all the required resources, it should be ready to launch once extracted. If the graphics look all crazy try running ChessInstall.exe (it won't affect your system, it just rebuilds the model files)
